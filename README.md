1. Write an Assembly Language Program to count the number of occurrence of 55H in a string of eight data bytes. The starting address of string is DS: 0030H. Store the count value in DS:0040H.

2. Write an Assembly Language Program to find out the location where 55H is placed in a string of eight data bytes. The starting address of string is DS: 0030H.

3. Write an Assembly Language Program to compare two strings. The first string is stored from memory location DS: 0030H and the second sting is stored from DS: 0040H.     Consider that the first byte of both strings contain the number of bytes contained in that string. If both strings are found equal, then show a value FFFFH in address DS: 0050H, otherwise show 1111H.

4. Write an Assembly Language Program to check if a string of five data bytes is palindrome or not. The string is stored from memory location DS: 0030H. If the string is found to be palindrome then place FFFFH in addresses DS: 0040H otherwise place 1111H.

5. Write an Assembly Language Program to count the number of positive and negative numbers present in a series of eight data bytes. The starting address of the series is DS: 0040H. Store the count value of positive number in DS: 0040H and count value of negative number in DS: 0041H.

6. Write an Assembly Language Program to separate the odd and even numbers from a series of 7 data bytes. The starting address of the series is DS: 0030H. Store the even numbers from DS: 0040H and the odd numbers from DS: 0050H.

7. Write an Assembly Language Program to convert an 8-bit number stored in DS: 0030H into its equivalent ASCII value. Store the converted code from DS: 0050H.

8. Write an Assembly Language Program to find out the square root of a number stored in DS: 0030H. Store the result in DS: 0040H.
Fibonacci series is defined as:

```F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2); for all i >2 with F(1) = F(2) = 1 Write an Assembly language Program to generate the first ten elements of this sequence and store them from DS: 0030H.```

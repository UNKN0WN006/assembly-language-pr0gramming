1. Write an Assembly Language Program to add two sixteen-bit numbers. The numbers are stored in DS: 0030H and DS: 0040H. Store the result in DS: 0050H, DS: 0051H, and DS: 0052H.soln

2. Write an Assembly Language Program to subtract an 8-bit numbers stored in DS: 0030H from a number stored in DS: 0040H using 2â€™s complement method. Store the result in DS: 0050H, and DS: 0051H.soln

3. Write a program to transfer a block of 8 data bytes from memory location DS: 0030H to DS: 0040H.soln

4. Write an 8086 Assembly Language Program for the addition of 7 eight-bit numbers stored from DS: 0030H. Store the result in DS: 0050H and DS: 0051H.soln

5. Write an 8086 Assembly Language Program for the addition of 5 sixteen-bit numbers stored from DS: 0030H. Store the result in DS: 0050H, DS: 0051H, DS: 0052H.soln

6. Write an Assembly Language Program for the addition of five BCD numbers stored from DS: 0030H. Store the result in DS: 0040H and DS: 0041H.

7. Write an Assembly Language Program to subtract a BCD number stored in DS: 0040H from a BCD number stored in DS: 0050H. Store the result in DS: 0060H and DS: 0061H.

8. Write an Assembly Language Program to multiply two eight bit number stored in DS: 0040H and DS: 0050H. Store the result from DS: 0060H.

9. Write an Assembly Language Program to multiply two sixteen bit number stored in DS:0040H and DS:0050H. Store the result from DS: 0060H.
